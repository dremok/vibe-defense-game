# Browser-Based Tower Defense Game

This is a TypeScript/Vite browser game following an iterative development approach with baby-step increments.

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS

### Before Starting ANY Work:
1. **ALWAYS read PROJECT_STATUS.md first** - Check current phase, completed tasks, and project health
2. **Before starting new phase** - Review PROJECT_STATUS.md to understand what's been completed
3. **After completing major milestones** - Update PROJECT_STATUS.md immediately

This ensures continuity between sessions and prevents duplicate work.

## Core Game Constants

```typescript
const CELL = 32;                    // Grid cell size in pixels
const canvas = { width: 960, height: 540 };  // Game resolution
const FPS = 60;                     // Fixed timestep target
```

## Critical Implementation Notes

### Game Loop Pattern
- Fixed timestep update at 60 FPS
- Variable render rate with interpolation
- Pause/speed controls affect update rate only

### Canvas Coordinate System
- Grid coordinates: [gx, gy] integers
- World coordinates: { x: gx*CELL + CELL/2, y: gy*CELL + CELL/2 }
- Convert grid centers for smooth entity movement

### Entity Management
- Enemies: array with alive flag, update/draw methods
- Towers: grid-based placement, range circles for debugging
- Projectiles: travel time, hit detection, damage application

### Balance Considerations
- Expose key values via Tweakpane for live tuning
- Maintain wave budget: sum of (hp Ã— speed Ã— count)
- Show DPS meters for tower effectiveness analysis

# CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES

## Baby Steps & Testing Protocol

**ðŸš¨ MANDATORY: Work in micro-increments and validate each step**

### Development Flow (NEVER DEVIATE):
1. **Identify smallest possible change** (1-3 lines max)
2. **Make the minimal change**  
3. **MANDATORY: Verify your work FIRST using available tools:**
   - **UI Changes**: Use Playwright MCP to take screenshots and verify visual results
   - **Game Logic**: Run unit tests with `yarn test` to verify functionality
   - **Other Changes**: Find appropriate verification method (console logs, file inspection, etc.)
4. **Iterate until satisfied** - Fix issues and re-verify until results match expectations
5. **THEN ask user to verify** - Only after YOU have confirmed it works correctly
6. **User confirms final result** before proceeding to next micro-increment

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: YOU must verify your own work before asking the user to check it**

### Verification Requirements by Change Type:

#### UI/Visual Changes (MANDATORY Playwright verification):
```bash
# Navigate to game: http://localhost:5173/
# Take before screenshot
# Make changes  
# Take after screenshot
# Compare and iterate until correct
# THEN ask user to verify
```

#### Game Logic Changes (MANDATORY unit test verification):
```bash
yarn test  # Must pass all existing tests
# Add new tests for new functionality
# Verify test coverage for critical paths
# THEN ask user to verify
```

#### Other Changes (Find appropriate verification):
- File structure: Use `ls` or `find` to verify files exist
- Configuration: Test build/dev commands work
- Dependencies: Verify imports/exports function
- Performance: Measure and compare benchmarks

### When to Ask User for Final Verification:
- After YOU have verified the change works correctly
- After all automated tests pass
- After visual verification shows expected results
- Before moving to the next major feature

## Debugging & Problem Solving

### When You Get Stuck:
- **STOP** trying the same approach repeatedly
- **ASK the user** for guidance or a different approach  
- **Simplify** - reduce to the most basic version that works
- **Test manually** in browser step by step
- **Don't assume** - validate every assumption with visual tests

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid:
- Avoid "workarounds", "heuristics", and other patches
- If you think a heuristic is useful, you are taking the wrong approach
- Consider breaking out of local maxima - backtrack if needed
- Don't be afraid to delete code that doesn't improve the game
- DO NOT keep broken code paths just to "get it done"

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Speed Multiplier Consistency
**ALL time-based systems MUST respect the speedMult variable:**
- Enemy spawning âœ… (spawnTimer affected by speedMult)
- Enemy movement âœ… (enemy speed affected by speedMult)  
- Projectile movement âœ… (projectile speed affected by speedMult)
- **Tower shooting rate** âœ… (shoot interval divided by speedMult)
- **Any future timers** MUST be affected by speedMult

**When adding ANY time-based feature, always ensure it scales with speed controls for consistent game feel.**

## Documentation Maintenance

**CRITICAL: Keep these files updated after any significant changes:**

### Required Updates After Each Phase/Milestone:
1. **README.md** - Primary project documentation
   - Update current phase status in header
   - Update tool inventory and capabilities
   - Update testing instructions
   - Update architecture overview

2. **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Detailed project tracking
   - Update "Last Updated" date
   - Update "Current Phase" status
   - Mark completed phases with âœ…
   - Update development velocity metrics
   - Update risk assessment
   - Update next steps and commands

3. **CLAUDE.md** (this file) - Implementation guidance
   - Update current implementation status
   - Update testing procedures
   - Update available tools list
   - Update server commands if changed

### When to Update Documentation:
- âœ… After completing any phase or major milestone
- âœ… After adding new tools or capabilities
- âœ… After successful integration testing
- âœ… After architecture changes
- âœ… When transitioning between phases

### ðŸš¨ MANDATORY SESSION WORKFLOW:
**At start of EVERY session:** Read PROJECT_STATUS.md to understand current state
**Before starting new phase:** Review PROJECT_STATUS.md for completed work
**After major changes:** Update PROJECT_STATUS.md immediately

### Documentation Standards:
- Use consistent phase numbering (Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 2.5, etc.)
- Mark completed items with âœ… and current work with ðŸš§
- Include specific metrics and data where available
- Provide clear testing instructions for new features
- Update risk levels based on current project health

## Context7 Documentation Usage

**ALWAYS use Context7 MCP server proactively when uncertain about:**
- Latest documentation for languages, libraries, frameworks
- Current best practices and API changes
- Modern tooling configurations and patterns
- Any rapidly evolving technology features

This ensures accurate, up-to-date implementation guidance rather than relying on potentially outdated knowledge.
