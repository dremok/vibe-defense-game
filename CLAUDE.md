# Browser-Based Tower Defense Game

This is a TypeScript/Vite browser game following an iterative development approach with baby-step increments.

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS

### Before Starting ANY Work:
1. **ALWAYS read PROJECT_STATUS.md first** - Check current phase, completed tasks, and project health
2. **Before starting new phase** - Review PROJECT_STATUS.md to understand what's been completed
3. **After completing major milestones** - Update PROJECT_STATUS.md immediately

This ensures continuity between sessions and prevents duplicate work.

## Development Commands

### Project Setup (COMPLETED âœ…)
```bash
# Project is already set up with working dependencies
cd vibe-defense-game
yarn install        # Install dependencies (preferred over npm)
```

### Development Server
```bash
yarn dev            # Start development server (http://localhost:5173/)
yarn build          # Build for production
yarn preview        # Preview production build
```

### Testing & Quality
```bash
yarn test           # Run unit tests (Vitest - 11 tests passing)
yarn lint           # ESLint (when configured)  
yarn format         # Prettier (when configured)
```

**Important:** Use `yarn` instead of `npm` for this project to avoid permission issues.

26. Achievement system: unlock progression

## Core Game Constants

```typescript
const CELL = 32;                    // Grid cell size in pixels
const canvas = { width: 960, height: 540 };  // Game resolution
const FPS = 60;                     // Fixed timestep target
```

## Critical Implementation Notes

### Game Loop Pattern
- Fixed timestep update at 60 FPS
- Variable render rate with interpolation
- Pause/speed controls affect update rate only

### Canvas Coordinate System
- Grid coordinates: [gx, gy] integers
- World coordinates: { x: gx*CELL + CELL/2, y: gy*CELL + CELL/2 }
- Convert grid centers for smooth entity movement

### Entity Management
- Enemies: array with alive flag, update/draw methods
- Towers: grid-based placement, range circles for debugging
- Projectiles: travel time, hit detection, damage application

### Balance Considerations
- Expose key values via Tweakpane for live tuning
- Maintain wave budget: sum of (hp Ã— speed Ã— count)
- Show DPS meters for tower effectiveness analysis

# CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES

## Baby Steps & Testing Protocol

**ðŸš¨ MANDATORY: Work in micro-increments and validate each step**

### Development Flow (NEVER DEVIATE):
1. **Identify smallest possible change** (1-3 lines max)
2. **Make the minimal change**  
3. **Test immediately** (run in browser, verify behavior)
4. **MANDATORY: Show results to user and get verification** 
5. **User must confirm:** "I can see [specific feature] working in browser"
6. **Only then** proceed to next micro-increment

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL:** User must test each change at http://localhost:5173/ and confirm it works before proceeding.

### Testing Requirements:
- **Test in browser after EVERY change** - no exceptions
- **Create simple test scenarios** for complex functionality
- **Show visual results** to user before claiming success
- **If something fails**, stop immediately and debug that specific issue

### When to Pause for User Verification:
- After implementing any new major feature
- After fixing any bug or error
- Before making architectural changes
- When visual results are unexpected
- When you're unsure about the next step

## Debugging & Problem Solving

### When You Get Stuck:
- **STOP** trying the same approach repeatedly
- **ASK the user** for guidance or a different approach  
- **Simplify** - reduce to the most basic version that works
- **Test manually** in browser step by step
- **Don't assume** - validate every assumption with visual tests

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid:
- Avoid "workarounds", "heuristics", and other patches
- If you think a heuristic is useful, you are taking the wrong approach
- Consider breaking out of local maxima - backtrack if needed
- Don't be afraid to delete code that doesn't improve the game
- DO NOT keep broken code paths just to "get it done"

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Speed Multiplier Consistency
**ALL time-based systems MUST respect the speedMult variable:**
- Enemy spawning âœ… (spawnTimer affected by speedMult)
- Enemy movement âœ… (enemy speed affected by speedMult)  
- Projectile movement âœ… (projectile speed affected by speedMult)
- **Tower shooting rate** âœ… (shoot interval divided by speedMult)
- **Any future timers** MUST be affected by speedMult

**When adding ANY time-based feature, always ensure it scales with speed controls for consistent game feel.**

## Documentation Maintenance

**CRITICAL: Keep these files updated after any significant changes:**

### Required Updates After Each Phase/Milestone:
1. **README.md** - Primary project documentation
   - Update current phase status in header
   - Update tool inventory and capabilities
   - Update testing instructions
   - Update architecture overview

2. **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Detailed project tracking
   - Update "Last Updated" date
   - Update "Current Phase" status
   - Mark completed phases with âœ…
   - Update development velocity metrics
   - Update risk assessment
   - Update next steps and commands

3. **CLAUDE.md** (this file) - Implementation guidance
   - Update current implementation status
   - Update testing procedures
   - Update available tools list
   - Update server commands if changed

### When to Update Documentation:
- âœ… After completing any phase or major milestone
- âœ… After adding new tools or capabilities
- âœ… After successful integration testing
- âœ… After architecture changes
- âœ… When transitioning between phases

### ðŸš¨ MANDATORY SESSION WORKFLOW:
**At start of EVERY session:** Read PROJECT_STATUS.md to understand current state
**Before starting new phase:** Review PROJECT_STATUS.md for completed work
**After major changes:** Update PROJECT_STATUS.md immediately

### Documentation Standards:
- Use consistent phase numbering (Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 2.5, etc.)
- Mark completed items with âœ… and current work with ðŸš§
- Include specific metrics and data where available
- Provide clear testing instructions for new features
- Update risk levels based on current project health

## Context7 Documentation Usage

**ALWAYS use Context7 MCP server proactively when uncertain about:**
- Latest documentation for languages, libraries, frameworks
- Current best practices and API changes
- Modern tooling configurations and patterns
- Any rapidly evolving technology features

This ensures accurate, up-to-date implementation guidance rather than relying on potentially outdated knowledge.
