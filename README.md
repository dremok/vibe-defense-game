## 🎯 Gameplay

### How to Play
1. **Start a Wave** - Click "Start Wave" to begin enemy spawning
2. **Place Towers** - Click on grass tiles to place towers (costs gold)
3. **Choose Tower Type**:
   - **Basic Tower** - 100 gold, good range, steady damage
   - **Sniper Tower** - 150 gold, longer range, predictive targeting
4. **Defend Your Base** - Don't let enemies reach the end (20 health points)
5. **Manage Economy** - Earn gold from kills to buy more towers
6. **Progress Through Waves** - 6 waves of increasing difficulty

### Game Balance
- **Wave 1-2**: 5-8 normal enemies, learn the basics
- **Wave 3**: Introduction of fast enemies (red triangles)
- **Wave 4-6**: Mixed enemy types with increasing counts
- **Speed Controls**: x1, x2, x4 multipliers maintain balanced difficulty
- **Tower Economy**: Balanced costs vs rewards for strategic decisions

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Ready for Phase 6+ expansion:
* **Tower Upgrades** - Multiple levels for each tower type
* **More Tower Types** - Splash damage, slow effects, etc.
* **Save/Load System** - LocalStorage persistence
* **Sound Effects** - Howler.js integration
* **Visual Effects** - Particle systems, animations
* **Multiple Maps** - JSON map loader system
* **Achievement System** - Progress tracking and unlocks

The modular architecture makes these additions straightforward to implement.
