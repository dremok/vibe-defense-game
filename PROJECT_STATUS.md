### Test Instructions:
1. Run `yarn dev`
2. Open http://localhost:5173/
3. Move mouse over canvas to see grid cell highlighting
4. Observe the S-shaped path of darker blue tiles
5. **Click "Start Wave"** to begin Wave 1 (auto-unpauses game)
6. **Watch "WAVE 1" splash screen** with enemy information (2 seconds)
7. **See 5 yellow circle enemies** spawn every 2 seconds and follow the path
8. **Click on grass tiles** to place blue towers (costs 100 gold each)
