- âœ… Package management (Yarn) with all dependencies installed
- âœ… HTML5 Canvas setup (960x540 resolution)
- âœ… Fixed timestep game loop (60 FPS target)
- âœ… FPS counter and performance monitoring
- âœ… Grid rendering system (32px cells)
- âœ… Game controls (Start/Pause/Speed multiplier)
- âœ… Development server configuration
- âœ… Production build system setup
- âœ… Documentation updates (README.md, CLAUDE.md)

#### Technical Achievements:
- Working TypeScript compilation
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) enabled  
- Clean separation of update/render loops
- Responsive canvas rendering
- Proper game state management (pause/resume)

### Phase 1 â€” Grid & Path âœ… COMPLETED
**Duration:** Single development session  
**Completion Date:** September 14, 2025

#### Completed Tasks:
- âœ… Grid coordinate system (world â†” grid conversion utilities)
- âœ… Mouse hover detection and grid highlighting
- âœ… Path definition system (S-shaped waypoint array)
- âœ… Road rendering (darker blue tiles on path)
- âœ… Interactive grid system with visual feedback

#### Technical Achievements:
- Clean grid coordinate conversion functions
- Real-time mouse position tracking
- Smooth hover highlighting with edge case handling
- Visual S-curve path clearly visible
- Solid foundation for enemy pathfinding

## ðŸš§ Next Phase Planning

### Phase 2 â€” Enemies & Base ðŸŽ¯ NEXT UP
**Estimated Duration:** 1-2 development sessions  
**Priority:** High  

#### Planned Tasks:
- [ ] Basic Enemy class with position and movement
- [ ] Pathfinding along defined waypoints
- [ ] Enemy spawning system with timer
- [ ] Base entity with health system
- [ ] Visual enemy representation (circle/shape)

#### Success Criteria:
- Single enemy smoothly following S-curve path
- Enemy reaches end and affects base health
- Continuous enemy spawning at intervals
- Visual feedback for enemy movement

## ðŸ”„ Development Workflow

### Current Commands:
```bash
yarn dev          # Development server  
yarn build        # Production build
yarn preview      # Preview production build
```

### Environment Status:
- **Node.js:** âœ… Compatible version
- **Yarn:** âœ… v1.22.22 installed and working
- **Vite:** âœ… v7.1.5 running successfully
- **TypeScript:** âœ… v5.9.2 compiling

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Upcoming Milestones

### Short Term (Phase 1)
- Enemy movement system
- Path rendering and definition
- Grid interaction (hover/click)

### Medium Term (Phase 2-3)  
- Tower placement system
- Basic combat mechanics
- Wave system implementation

### Long Term (Phase 4+)
- Multiple tower types
- Advanced enemy variants
- Polish and deployment

---

## ðŸ’¡ Notes and Decisions

### Technical Decisions Made:
- **Package Manager:** Yarn (chosen over npm due to permission issues)
- **Build Tool:** Vite (fast development and HMR)
- **Canvas Resolution:** 960x540 (good balance for development)
- **Grid Size:** 32px cells (optimal for tower defense gameplay)
- **Loop Strategy:** Fixed timestep (consistent gameplay across devices)

### Development Approach:
- Baby steps methodology with immediate testing
- Test-driven incremental development  
- Browser-first validation for each feature
- Documentation-driven development

---

## ðŸš¨ Risk Assessment

### Current Risks: LOW
- âœ… Development environment stable
- âœ… Dependencies resolved
- âœ… Build system functional
- âœ… No blocking technical issues

### Monitoring Areas:
- Performance with increased entity counts
- Browser compatibility across versions
- Mobile responsive considerations (future)

**Next Steps:**
1. Begin Phase 1 implementation
2. Add grid coordinate conversion utilities  
3. Implement mouse interaction system
4. Create first enemy entity with movement
